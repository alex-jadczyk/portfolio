# Portfolio
This is my portfolio code, can be seen live on http://alex-jadczyk.github.io/portfolio

## Things I like about this page:
- should work well on different devices (thanks to Bootstrap 4.0 based on flexbox)
- I made all icons and favicon myself using Adobe Illustrator

## Other remarks:

This page was fast and easy to code, my own design. The only thing missing is the interaction (could be even made with pure CSS; for now I could not think of anything fitting this page). I used ready-made solutions like Bootstrap, Animate.css and jQuery code for smooth page scroll.
