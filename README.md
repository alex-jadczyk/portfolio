# Portfolio
This is my portfolio code, can be seen live on http://alex-jadczyk.github.io/portfolio

## Things I like about this page:
- should work well on different devices (thanks to Bootstrap 4.0 based on flexbox)
- I made all icons and favicon myself using Adobe Illustrator

## Things I still need to work on:
- the contact form does not work because I could not decide on the backend I wanted to develop myself in (probably I will just stick with ol' good PHP for now)
- 'project' section needs to be updated

This page was fast and easy to code, I designed it fully myself. The only thing missing is the interaction (could be even made with pure CSS; for now I could not think of anything fitting this page). I used ready-made solutions like Bootstrap, Animate.css and Javascript code for smooth page scroll.
